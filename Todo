How do I create better prompts?

Creating an image with Image Creator works differently from searching for an image in Bing.

It works best when you're highly descriptive. So, get creative and add details: adjectives, locations, even artistic styles such as "digital art" or "photorealistic."

Here's an example of a how to create a longer, more descriptive prompt:

Original prompt: "astronaut"
Descriptive prompt: "a close-up photo of an astronaut in a glowing suit made of plasma, as if the galaxy is inside of it, putting on their helmet, but you can't see their face because of the visor, realistic, film stock, bright colors"

Smiling, she went to their bedroom to put on the sexy lingerie she had ordered earlier that week. She had been planning this moment for days and had finally found the right time to show him what she was made of. How could he ignore her for almost a month? She just couldn’t take it anymore and was going all out to get his attention.</p><p>Mr. Jin was her husband, and they had been married for two years. Their sex life had always been good, but for almost a month now, she had noticed he was withdrawing and rarely touched her. Some nights, she would wear something very revealing to awaken his desire, but he would just kiss her and cuddle her to sleep. At one point, she thought he might be cheating. However, after thorough investigation, she realized she was wrong. Her husband loved her and showed it in many ways: surprising her with gifts, roses, and little love notes. What then could be the problem? she wondered. Was he impotent? No! She scolded herself for even thinking that. Whatever it was, tonight she intended to find out.</p><p>Mr. Jin had just returned to his office after a series of meetings. This had been his life for almost a month—nonstop work with barely any time to breathe, let alone relax. As he sat down to finish some paperwork, he remembered the message his wife had sent him earlier. He hurriedly pulled out his phone and opened it. It was a picture with a note that read, *“Come home, baby boy. Mama is waiting.”* He was speechless. His heart raced as he stared at the picture, and he couldn’t wait to finish his work so he could rush home to her. That woman—she sure knew how to provoke him. He missed her already.</p><p>As soon as he signed the last paper, the image of her message flashed through his mind again. Slipping his phone back into his pocket, but not before sneaking another peek at the picture, he grabbed his bag and car keys and headed home.</p><p><br>She was dressed and ready. She lit candles in the room, sprayed a sweet fragrance over the bed adorned with rose petals, and smiled as she reminisced about their second wedding anniversary when her husband had surprised her with something similar. Carefully placing a rose in her hair, she admired her reflection in the mirror and smiled with satisfaction. Her alarm went off—it was time. Just as she reached the living room, she heard her husband’s car honk. She sat on the table in the center of the room, her legs parted in a way that revealed her thighs and a teasing glimpse of her intimate curves. The door opened.</p><p>Nothing could have prepared Mr. Jin for what he was about to see. He always knew his wife was bold, but this was beyond his imagination. She was wearing a black see-through gown that left nothing to the imagination. He could clearly see her curves and her nipples. He swallowed hard, still in shock, when her sweet voice brought him back to reality.</p><p>“You’re home, honey. Come and eat,” she said seductively.</p><p>“Eat? Mama, I want to eat you up right…” he started, but his sentence trailed off as she stood up, kissed him softly, and took his bag. Then, she led him to the dining table.</p><p>“Oh, this is the food,” he thought, as the delicious aroma hit his senses, reminding him how hungry he was.</p><p>“Babe,” he said, smiling at her. She gestured for him to sit down. She had made rice and beef stew with fried plantains, paired with a glass of orange juice. They sat down to eat.</p><p>His wife had flawless, fair skin and a perfect body that could drive any man wild. While they were eating, he felt her foot slide up his thigh under the table, teasing him. It was impossible to focus on the food. Just as he was about to give in to his desire, she stopped him.</p><p>“No, baby. Mama put a lot of effort into making dinner, and she won’t be happy if you don’t eat. So, be a good boy and eat up,” she said playfully.</p><p>He wondered what kind of game she was playing but decided to humor her. Smiling, he continued eating.</p><p><br>When they were done with dinner, she began clearing the table. As she leaned over to pick up a spoon she had “accidentally” dropped, her teasing posture revealed everything once again. Jin’s desire flared as he watched, but before he could act, she was already walking to the kitchen. He decided to wait patiently for her return.</p><p>Five minutes passed, and there was no sign of her. He couldn’t take it anymore. He went to the kitchen to find her, but she wasn’t there. As he turned to leave, he noticed a note taped to the door: *“Meet me in the bedroom.”*</p><p>He practically ran upstairs, bursting into the bedroom. The room was dimly lit with red lights, and the air was filled with the same sweet fragrance. As his eyes adjusted, he saw her sitting on the bed in the same provocative pose she had struck earlier. Only this time, her legs were spread wider, and the rose she had worn in her hair was now between her lips. She tilted her head back, exposing her neck and a hint of her breasts.</p><p>“F**k,” he muttered under his breath, taking long strides toward her. As he got closer, he slowed down, savoring the sight. He smiled, bent down, and kissed her. She wrapped her arms around his neck and deepened the kiss. In one swift motion, he tore off his shirt, revealing his sculpted abs and toned chest. She couldn’t resist running her hands over his muscles.</p><p>She gasped softly when he pinched her nipples, but she quickly regained control, flipping him onto his back.</p><p>“Really, Mama?” he teased, laughing.</p><p>They both chuckled as she leaned down to kiss him. Tracing kisses down his body, she unbuckled his belt and took him into her mouth. He groaned, overwhelmed by the sensation. Just as he was nearing his climax, she stopped, hovering over him.</p><p>“Not now, baby boy,” she whispered into his ear with a mischievous smile.</p><p>Sliding off her gown, she revealed every curve of her perfect body. He ran his hands over her skin, marveling at her beauty. She positioned herself over him and slid him inside her.</p><p>“God, my wife is beautiful,” he thought as she began moving. Her rhythm started slow, but soon she was bouncing faster. He groaned, gripping her hips.</p><p>“Say my name,” he whispered.</p><p>“Jin,” she moaned breathlessly.</p><p>“I’m coming,” she cried out.</p><p>“Not yet,” he ordered, flipping her over so he was on top. He lifted her legs over his shoulders and thrust into her deeply.</p><p>“Jin!” she screamed as he drove them both to the edge. When she finally climaxed, he followed, releasing himself inside her.</p><p>Afterward, he kissed her lovingly and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>“Why have you been avoiding me?” she asked, looking into his eyes.</p><p>He smiled and replied, “We won the contract, babe.”</p><p>Her brow furrowed in confusion. “What contract?”</p><p>“The one with the London company,” he said.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. “Babe! You didn’t tell me you were pursuing it!”</p><p>He smiled. “I knew how much you wanted to relocate to the States, and this contract gives us that opportunity. I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want to raise your hopes in case it didn’t work out.”</p><p>She hugged him tightly. “Thank you for being the best husband.”</p><p>“And thank you for being the best wife,” he replied.</p><p>She smiled, leaned into his chest, and drifted off to sleep in his arms.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>', 'She had planned every detail, from the sultry lingerie to the candlelit room.

Set in the picturesque town of Messina, Italy, the play explores themes of love, deception, honor, and societal expectations all through the lens of its colorful characters and their tangled relationships.</p><h3>The Players and the Setting</h3><p>The story unfolds in the home of Leonato, the governor of Messina. As the play begins, Leonato receives news that a group of soldiers, led by the noble Don Pedro, is returning from a successful campaign. Among them are the charming Claudio, the witty Benedick, and Don Pedro’s resentful, illegitimate brother, Don John. Leonato welcomes the soldiers into his home, setting the stage for romantic entanglements and comedic chaos.</p><p>At the heart of the story are two very different romantic plots: the youthful and straightforward love of Claudio and Hero and the fiery, combative relationship between Benedick and Beatrice. Both pairs will face trials and transformations before finding resolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Act I: Love and Mockery</h3><p>When Claudio lays eyes on Hero, Leonato’s gentle and virtuous daughter, he is immediately smitten. With Don Pedro’s help, Claudio secures Hero’s love, and their engagement is swiftly arranged. Meanwhile, Benedick and Beatrice engage in their usual verbal sparring. Both are fiercely independent and mock the idea of marriage, declaring that they will remain single forever. Beatrice, in particular, takes delight in teasing Benedick, while Benedick matches her with biting humor of his own.</p><p>While the younger Claudio and Hero represent idealized love, Benedick and Beatrice embody a more complex and reluctant kind of affection. Their witty banter hints at a deeper connection beneath the surface, though neither is willing to admit it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Acts II-III: Schemes of Love and Malice</h3><p>With the engagement of Claudio and Hero settled, the focus shifts to a playful conspiracy. Don Pedro and Leonato, along with Hero and others, decide to trick Benedick and Beatrice into falling for each other. They stage conversations—carefully timed to be overheard—suggesting that Beatrice is secretly in love with Benedick, and vice versa. The plan works marvelously. Benedick and Beatrice, moved by these \"revelations,\" begin to reconsider their feelings, and their antagonistic dynamic gives way to an awkward and burgeoning affection.</p><p>However, not all the schemes in Messina are so lighthearted. Don John, driven by envy and bitterness, hatches a plot to ruin the happiness of Claudio and Hero. He persuades Claudio that Hero is unfaithful by orchestrating a scene in which his accomplice, Borachio, woos Hero’s maid, Margaret, at Hero’s window. From a distance, Claudio and Don Pedro are led to believe that Hero has betrayed Claudio’s trust.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Act IV: Tragedy at the Altar</h3><p>On the day of the wedding, Claudio publicly accuses Hero of infidelity, rejecting her at the altar. Humiliated and heartbroken, Hero faints. Her family, believing that her honor has been unjustly destroyed, devises a plan to protect her: they will spread the rumor that Hero has died of shock and grief. This ruse will give them time to uncover the truth and restore her reputation.</p><p>Beatrice, devastated by the treatment of her cousin, turns to Benedick for help. In a moment of vulnerability, she asks him to prove his love by challenging Claudio to a duel. This marks a turning point for Benedick and Beatrice’s relationship, as their love deepens from playful flirtation to genuine loyalty and support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Act V: Truth Unveiled and Love Triumphant</h3><p>Don John’s treachery is eventually exposed when the bumbling constable, Dogberry, and his comical band of watchmen apprehend Borachio and uncover the plot. With the truth revealed, Claudio is overcome with remorse. Believing Hero to be dead, he agrees to marry another \"mystery\" bride as an act of penance. To his astonishment and joy, the bride turns out to be Hero, alive and well. The couple is reunited, and their love is renewed.</p><p>Benedick and Beatrice, after much hemming and hawing, finally confess their feelings for each other. Their love is sealed with a kiss and a promise of marriage. In the play’s final moments, Don John is captured and brought to justice, and the citizens of Messina celebrate with music, dancing, and merriment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Themes and Legacy</h3><p><i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> is more than just a romantic comedy; it is a nuanced exploration of human relationships. The play contrasts the idealized love of Claudio and Hero with the more realistic, witty, and equal partnership of Benedick and Beatrice. It also delves into the destructive power of lies and the redemptive power of truth.</p><p>The title itself—\"much ado about nothing\"—is a clever pun, as the word \"nothing\" was pronounced similarly to \"noting\" in Shakespeare’s time, highlighting the play’s focus on observation, misinterpretation, and rumor.</p><p>With its sparkling dialogue and timeless themes, <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> remains one of Shakespeare’s most popular and enduring works, a testament to his genius in capturing the complexities of love, trust, and human folly.<br><br>Read the full book <a href=\"https://books.google.com.ng/books/about/Much_Ado_about_Nothing.html?id=-X80AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">here</a>.</p>', 'An insight into William Shakespeare\'s Much Ado About Nothing, a timeless comedy of love, deception, and redemption.

The witches prophecy that Macbeth will become the Thane of Cawdor and then king, while Banquo\'s descendants will inherit the throne instead of Macbeth’s own bloodline.</p><p>Soon after, Macbeth is indeed made the Thane of Cawdor, confirming part of the witches’ prophecy. This revelation sparks a dangerous ambition in Macbeth, especially after he begins to fantasize about the possibility of becoming king. Lady Macbeth, his wife, is equally ambitious and ruthless. Upon learning of the prophecy, she urges Macbeth to take immediate action and murder King Duncan, who is visiting their castle, in order to seize the throne. Macbeth hesitates, aware of the moral and political consequences, but is eventually persuaded by his wife’s relentless encouragement.</p><h3>Act 2: The Murder</h3><p>Macbeth follows through with the murder of King Duncan, striking him down in his sleep. However, after the deed is done, Macbeth is overwhelmed with guilt and fear. He hears voices and imagines he sees a dagger guiding him toward Duncan’s chamber, but he does not let his fear stop him from completing the murder. He returns to his wife, who helps him cover up the crime by framing the guards for the murder.</p><p>In the morning, Duncan’s body is discovered, and chaos erupts. Macbeth, in a feigned fit of rage, kills the guards to avenge the king’s death. Duncan’s sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee for their lives, suspecting that they are in danger, which deepens suspicion about the murder.</p><h3>Act 3: Macbeth’s Paranoia</h3><p>With Duncan dead, Macbeth becomes the new king, but his guilt continues to gnaw at him. He is tormented by the witches\' prophecy that Banquo’s descendants will inherit the throne, not his own. Driven by paranoia, Macbeth arranges for the murder of Banquo and his son, Fleance. Banquo is killed, but Fleance escapes.</p><p>Despite Banquo’s death, Macbeth remains haunted by his ghost. At a banquet, he sees Banquo’s ghost sitting at his place, and his erratic behavior terrifies his guests. Lady Macbeth tries to cover up her husband’s strange behavior, but the damage is done. Macbeth’s reign is marked by increasing fear and instability.</p><h3>Act 4: Macbeth’s Downfall</h3><p>Desperate to secure his throne, Macbeth returns to the witches for guidance. They show him a series of apparitions that give him cryptic assurances: no man born of a woman can harm him, and he will not be defeated until Birnam Wood moves to Dunsinane Hill. These prophecies give him false confidence, leading him to believe that he is invincible.</p><p>Meanwhile, Macduff, a nobleman who suspects Macbeth of the murder of Duncan, learns that his family has been slaughtered on Macbeth’s orders. Filled with rage, Macduff joins forces with Malcolm, Duncan’s son, and they raise an army to overthrow Macbeth. In their march toward Dunsinane, they camouflage themselves with branches from Birnam Wood, making it appear as though the forest is moving.</p><h3>Act 5: The Final Confrontation</h3><p>Lady Macbeth, overwhelmed by guilt and mental instability, begins to sleepwalk and reenact the events surrounding Duncan’s murder. She is seen trying to wash imagined bloodstains from her hands, mumbling about the crime. Her mental deterioration symbolizes the destructive effects of guilt and the corrosive nature of unchecked ambition.</p><p>In the final act, Macbeth prepares for battle as Macduff’s army approaches. He feels invincible due to the witches’ prophecy, but his confidence is shattered when he learns that Macduff was born through a Caesarean section, meaning he was not “born of a woman” in the usual sense. In the ensuing battle, Macduff kills Macbeth, fulfilling the witches\' prophecy.</p><p>After Macbeth’s death, Malcolm is crowned king, restoring order to Scotland. However, the play ends with a sense of foreboding, as the destructive consequences of ambition and the thirst for power are laid bare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Themes and Interpretation</strong> The central themes of <i>Macbeth</i> revolve around the corrupting power of unchecked ambition and the consequences of moral compromise. Macbeth’s ascent to power is marked by a series of increasingly violent actions, and his reign is plagued by paranoia and guilt. Lady Macbeth, initially portrayed as the more ruthless of the two, also succumbs to guilt, showcasing how ambition can consume even the most determined individuals.</p><p>The supernatural elements, especially the witches and their prophecies, play a crucial role in the play. They manipulate Macbeth’s desires and create a sense of fate that drives his actions. However, the play also questions whether the witches merely predict the future or actively influence it. The tension between fate and free will is another key aspect of the play.</p><p>Ultimately, <i>Macbeth</i> is a powerful tragedy that reflects the dangers of ambition, the complexities of human nature, and the devastating consequences of moral corruption. It remains one of Shakespeare’s most compelling works, offering deep insights into the darker aspects of the human condition.</p>', 'Shakespeare\'s Macbeth explores the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition.

James Clear explains how habits work, why they’re so powerful, and how you can use this knowledge to make lasting changes in your life. Clear breaks down the process of building and maintaining habits into four clear steps—cue, craving, response, and reward—creating a framework that you can use to replace bad habits with good ones.</p><p>The core premise of <i>Atomic Habits</i> is that small improvements accumulate over time. Clear’s method of focusing on the system rather than the goal itself is revolutionary. Instead of obsessing over lofty, distant objectives, Clear advocates for focusing on making tiny improvements each day, a strategy that’s both sustainable and highly effective.</p><p>Clear’s actionable advice begins with the concept of the \"compound growth of habits.\" He emphasizes that habits compound like interest in a bank account—small efforts made every day may seem insignificant at first, but their long-term impact can be profound. This is why habits are so powerful: when combined, tiny actions can create huge results.</p><p>The book also discusses how identity plays a key role in habit formation. Clear argues that the most effective way to change a habit is not by focusing on what you want to achieve, but on who you want to become. For instance, instead of saying \"I want to lose weight,\" focus on becoming a person who eats healthy or exercises regularly. This shift in focus helps create lasting change, as it aligns the habit with your identity.</p><p>Clear also tackles how to break bad habits. His \"four laws of behavior change\" provide a systematic approach to breaking habits: make it invisible, make it unattractive, make it difficult, and make it unsatisfying. Each law targets a different part of the habit loop to help disrupt undesirable behavior patterns.</p><p>The book is also filled with practical tips for creating environments that encourage good habits. Clear stresses the importance of environment design, such as placing healthy food at eye level in your fridge or eliminating distractions that lead to procrastination. The book provides strategies for making good habits easier and bad habits harder to perform.</p><p>One of the most memorable aspects of the book is Clear’s concept of \"habit stacking,\" which involves pairing a new habit with an already established habit. This makes it easier to form new habits because you’re already used to performing the anchor habit. For example, you can stack the habit of doing ten push-ups right after brushing your teeth. This way, you\'re more likely to follow through with both actions.</p><p>Clear also emphasizes the power of small wins, explaining that by focusing on getting just 1% better each day, you can achieve remarkable results over time. His philosophy is about the long-term process, not quick fixes. He provides multiple real-life examples of how this method has worked for successful individuals in various fields, showing readers that small improvements add up to great success.</p><p>In addition, the book highlights the significance of tracking your progress and celebrating small milestones. Tracking allows you to see the improvements, reinforcing the behavior and motivating you to keep going. It’s a way to visualize success and push through moments when motivation wanes.</p><p>Finally, <i>Atomic Habits</i> also introduces the concept of \"The Plateau of Latent Potential,\" which explains why progress often feels slow at the beginning. Clear encourages readers to trust the process and keep going even when results aren’t immediately visible, reminding them that breakthrough moments often come after sustained effort.</p><p>Overall, <i>Atomic Habits</i> is not just a book about habit formation—it\'s a comprehensive guide to transforming your life by understanding the power of tiny, consistent actions. Clear’s principles offer a roadmap for creating lasting, positive change, helping you to become the best version of yourself.</p>', 'In Atomic Habits, James Clear reveals how tiny, incremental changes can lead to massive personal transformation. Drawing from the latest research in psychology and neuroscience, Clear shows that habits are the key to success and offers actionable steps to help you build good habits and break bad ones, ensuring that you can become the person you’ve always wanted to be.', 'popular', 'published', 1, 2, NULL, '2024-12-08 11:21:08.072162', '2024-12-10 00:10:11.589021', 'Atomic Habits by James Clear: A Guide to Mastering Small Changes for Big Success', 'The secrets to lasting success with Atomic Habits by James Clear.

The red-orange glow reflecting off the mirrors blinded his vision completely. There was no visible exit. Creating a wind funnel would blast the whole building to smithereens. Anyone who didn’t know a fire was the cause of the light would think someone pulled the sun in.<br>Speaking of the sun, this new meta was strangely powerful. He was technically the sun in human shape and anytime he appeared, everyone got temporarily blinded. Barry had made notes about him. One was that he seemed unstable and not in total control of his powers and Barry doubted any meta could be so powerful except if aided by magic. Nothing at Star Labs had helped. They had reopened and were busy providing some sort of sunshades Cisco had invented to the public to shield their eyes against the meta’s brilliant glow. Flashades, Cisco had called them. Meh. He was losing his touch.<br>Finally spotting the woman reported to have been stuck in the burning building, Barry sped out of the building just in time to see the fire meta staring down in what seemed like disgust to Barry. He couldn’t really say; the shine was blinding. Did he even have a face? His eyes were glowing even more. Right then Barry discovered he was loading up his sunbeams, planning on firing it at the women he just rescued. It was time to move fast. He hoped the Mass Punch would serve its purpose this time. Grodd had embarrassed him so much. He sped off and started moving at his highest speed around the edges of the city. BOOOOMMM!<br>“Wow, Barry just obliterated his speed record!” Cisco shouted, his eyes on the red dot on the monitor screen zooming around Central City that was Barry. “And all the glasses on all the buildings he just passed beside...”<br>Finally speeding towards the fire-wielding meta, from the far distance, he caught sight of the sunbeams from his eyes almost making contact with the victims. Oh no, he thought, I can’t make it on time. But I can make it ‘in time’. A Speed Force portal opened immediately in front of him and he continued his booming speed into it.<br>“Aaaarghhh, help…,” The women’s voices were drowned out by the sizzling hiss of the sunbeams as it made contact with their frail flesh.<br>Team Flash froze in horror, eyes wide open in fear. “Barry’s gone”, Cisco managed, but it came out in a squeak. “He’s disappeared.”<br>2 HOURS LATER. STAR LABS<br>Team Flash was in a complete state of panic.<br>“How are we going to find him?”<br>“Those women…”<br>“He’s gone.”<br>“What really happened, Cisco?”<br>“I don’t know. He’s vitals were better than ever and he just…sort of disappeared.”<br>“I’m developing the if-Barry-is-gone-how-is-Central City-gonna-survive-phobia…”<br>Caitlin looked around. The whole place was in a mess. Not the place literally. Its occupants. He was Barry, wasn’t he? If so, then he was already on his way home and in five minutes he’d be back here telling them of how the villain was defeated.<br>Or so she thought. What if he came back two hours ago?<br>54 YEARS EARLIER. 1963, NOVEMBER 22ND. 10:30am.<br>“Owww, that hurt.” Barry said, “What happened?”<br>He remembered. Right after he’d entered into the portal, Black Flash had attacked him. So the Speed Force had a gatekeeper now, huh? They had fought throughout time and he had narrowly avoided it by opening another of the 147 portals they had opened during their fight and pretending to run into it while silently phasing. Black Flash had sped through him and into the portal and it had closed up. It was bound to come back though, but not until he had found his way back to his proper timeline. Now to find out where he was. Or when he was, as a matter of fact. It sounded absurd.<br>He found out from a passer-by who was staring curiously at his costume. I know, Barry thought, even the 1990s Flash hadn’t been born yet. He was in November 22nd, 1963. The day JFK died. At least two hours before that. But he wasn’t about to witness that. It was time to travel…in time. But then, first things first.<br>2017. 1 MINUTE BEFORE BARRY DISAPPEARED.<br>The fiery meta saw The Flash rescue the woman from the building he had set on fire and then zoom off as he started loading his beams. With a laugh like the sound fire crackling, he tilted the upper part of his body backwards and fired back like a bullet from a rifle, the beams moving out of his eye sockets at incredible speeds. From the corner of his eye, he saw The Flash disappear into a bluish wormhole in the far distance. Good, he thought, you better run, speedster.<br>Suddenly the bluish hole appeared. He felt it before he saw it. He knew the force of the punch was going to knock him into orbit.<br>BARRY<br>Barry ran around and around the city and jumped into the opening portal, hoping his trick would work. At the far end of the tunnel-like wormhole, he saw the exact image he’d expected. Fifty feet up in the air, right in front of the fire meta’s face. In the incredible speed of motion, Barry pressed his boots against the floorless ground of the wormhole and launched himself forward towards the meta. He drew his fist back and…<br>FIRE META<br>BOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!<br>The wave emanating from the point of contact between Barry’s fist and the meta’s face was clearly visible and lined with streaks of yellow lightning. Every electronic equipment that the wave vibrated through shut down. Minor blackout in the area, major blackout in the fire meta’s head.<br>BARRY<br>Barry created a small burst of wind from his arms to help him land. “Cisco, can you hear me? Cisco…” His earpiece’s sound wave fluctuated. The meta was no more glowing. He lay five feet into the ground in the crater his crash had created. Anyway, it was time to go home. Like Star Labs home.<br>After safely locking the meta in the dampening cell, the whole team stared at him.<br>“What?” Barry asked.<br>“Where did you learn that trick?” Cisco demanded. “It was awesome!”<br>“I knew that whenever I time travel, I land on the spot I want to land. Or fly. So I used it to my advantage. Basically, I used it as a breach. The Speed Force has many appliances.” Barry said. “Is that why you’re all staring at me? Really.”<br>“Your suit’s changed, dude.” Cisco said. “And charged, too. My suit, actually.”<br>Barry stared in the mirror. The suit was flecked with not a yellow color but yellow lightning. The empty lines from the corners of the cowl were shining brilliantly.<br>“I just ran a test.” Caitlin said. “Apart from you being 6 times faster, your suit has enough energy to power Star Labs for 1 month, alone.”<br>“Whoa.” Barry said, intrigued.<br>“The lightning emanating from your body throughout your trip affected the molecules and atoms of the suit, storing Speed Force energy in each atom. Though you have time travelled before without this happening, the Speed Force is still a realm with unexplained energies. Science may have linked you to it but we cannot come to a conclusion that it is not magic.” Caitlin concluded.<br>“At this point, anybody, meta or not, wearing your suit will be able to move at superhuman speeds.” Cisco said. “I’m excited!”<br>“Well, what can I say?” Barry said lamely. “We’ll check all that out later.”<br>As he puts off the suit onto the mannequin, it begins to draw power from the light bulbs around the whole room. Everything goes dark. As the lights come back on slowly, they see the former space of the mannequin empty. A being runs around in super speed and stops in front of the team.<br>“Oh my god,” Cisco said, “Is that…?”<br>The mannequin, now with total human features, all gray in color, stands before them, with the Flash suit fitting tightly on it and lightning sparkling all around it.<br>“I AM ALIVE!”<br>THE END</p>', 'A thrilling The Flash fanfiction where The Flash faces a blazing new meta with devastating powers, navigates the complexities of time travel, and discovers a new mysterious evolution.

As it did so, it became incredibly faster and the gap between it and Barry widened.

All I can tell you is that it’s a mannequin.”<br>Dr. Caitlin Snow cleared her throat and said, “Barry, after some tests through the suit, the powerful amount of energy was discovered to have transformed its properties totally, bringing it to life. Apart from the apparent super speed it benefits from the suit, its brainpower is about an I.Q. of 154 and the greatest of its abilities is a very powerful one: the suit draws common electricity without tactile contact and passing it through the suit turns it into Speed Force electricity constantly powering the wearer of the suit, in this case the mannequin.<br>“Oh my god.” Barry said. “I’m doomed.”<br>“So basically, if it keeps moving in the city, it gets more powerful and increasingly faster.” Cisco chipped in. “And with an Intelligence Quotient of that rate, we better employ a genius of ours.”<br>“What’s Harry always doing in the lab downstairs anyway?”<br>CENTRAL CITY<br>WHOOOOOSSSSHHHHHH<br>The newly-formed being sped around a building at high speed, causing a flux in its molecular structure, making it collapse to the ground.

That…thing is destroying my city in The Flash’s costume and name. My name!”<br>“You know, there’s this other costume I’m working on. You might have to start over as a new hero.<br>Some minutes later, Barry was outfitted in a green costume. It was armless but Cisco handed him a pair of black fingerless gloves.<br>“Well,” Cisco said. “It is something.”<br>Barry sped off.<br>“That mannequin is in trouble.” Caitlin said.<br>Barry saw it at the Central City Picture News (CCPN). Immediately, it sped towards him. Let’s do this, Barry thought. The streak of yellow lightning zoomed across Central City. Barry aimed a punch at it but it dodged, grabbed Barry’s arm and pulled him over, throwing a punch of its own towards Barry’s face. As Barry landed some feet away, it ran and this time grabbed Barry’s foot and started pulling him away at super speed. Barry felt the heat of his butt dragging along the concrete though the suit was tri-polymer: friction proof. After a few minutes, he stopped abruptly, throwing Barry overhead to leave him sprawling in the dirt a few feet away.<br>“Sorry, fellow speedster, I own this city. Not you.”<br>“You are just another evil guy with speed that I have to deal with.”<br>“I see. What about you become the villain for some time, uh? What about that?”<br>Its features started to change color and texture and as lightning sparked around it, it blended into a replica of Barry.<br>“Now who’s the villain, Flash? Now who’s the villain?” It shouted and sped off, leaving Barry in the dust.<br>STAR LABS<br>“I told you that you were far more than dead.” Cisco said. “Harry, we need help. And if you’re gonna stay silent, you might as well remove your brain and lend it to us.”<br>Harry looked around as he always did, then said, “The more it runs in the city, the more it becomes stronger and its power source remains intact. You’ll have to lead it somewhere absent of electricity and then get it to expend its available energy. Think you’ll last enough to accomplish that?”<br>“Well, yes, and now that we know how to defeat him, what’s the plan?” Barry said.<br>“What about that tech you used to drain Barry’s speed for Zoom, Harry? Think you still have it?” Cisco asked.<br>“It might come in handy.” Harry said.<br>Barry suited up in his new costume. Armed with the speed-draining tech and a plan, he took off. The mannequin had created a path of destruction along the city, so Barry followed. He finally found it on the top of a building.<br>“I knew you’d come.” It said.<br>“So why didn’t you throw a welcoming party? Aren’t I worthy a guest?”<br>“You are not even worthy an opponent.”<br>WHOOOOSSSSHHHHHH<br>The surrounding walls echoed with the sound waves emanating from their punches. They zoomed off again. Suddenly the mannequin split into two images in front of Barry. A speed mirage.<br>“Barry.” Cisco shouted through the earpiece. “Do not, I repeat, do not let him follow you if you open a wormhole. The Speed Force energies would stabilize him and make him unstoppable!”<br>“Alright, I hear you.”<br>Barry went after the mirage that had cornered into an alley, but realized too late. It was a trap. Barriers sparked up around him. Just like the one he had used to trap the Reverse Flash.<br>“You should recognize this.” The mannequin said maniacally. “I have to bring you to justice, Flash. Don’t you see? No matter who you think you are or what you call yourself, the guy in the red costume and yellow lightning always wins. You’re in green, Barry. And I am in red.”<br>“Do you even know traffic lights? Red means stop and green means GO!” Barry shouted the signal word to his invisible accomplice.<br>“I agree.” A deep male voice came from above. “I love it when the arrow says green.”<br>TWISSSSHHHH. An arrow with its end connected to a rope struck into the wall opposite its source and tightened. Oliver Queen came sliding down. He nodded towards Barry.<br>“Thought you wouldn’t come.” Barry said.<br>“I’m always green for a friend.”<br>“Look who’s here. The not-so-smug Green Arrow.” The mannequin said mockingly. “And he’s come for a beating. Your luck’s bound to run out someday. That day’s today.”<br>“Let’s see who gets to marry Lady Luck.” The Green Arrow said. “I promised her a honeymoon in Dubai. You proposed yet?”<br>The speedster proceeded to beat Oliver at super speed, knowing it had the upper hand.<br>“Arghhh.” Oliver groaned as he was punched square in the gut, in the midst of the surrounding lightning. “I stopped Barry once, you know.”<br>“I am not Barry!” The voice came from the whooshing lightning.<br>“No, you’re not.” Oliver managed. “Barry’s now in green tights. I always beat the ones in red. And I’m going to do it again.”<br>Oliver closed his eyes, calculated quickly and swung an arrowhead to the left. It hit the mannequin square in the chest. He then pulled a move that took its legs off the ground, sending it into the air. He hit it forcefully, driving its back to the ground. He sprayed stinging gas in its eyes and using that as a smokescreen, quickly removed the suit’s emblem. He brought out the speed-draining tech and fixed it to it. Immediately, the mannequin speed-punched Arrow a good distance away and stood up.<br>“Seems Lady Luck is reconsidering your proposal.” It sneered.<br>“No, she’s not. We already said our vows. You wanna come to the wedding? Here’s your invitation card.” Oliver said, holding up the emblem.<br>“That’s mine!” The mannequin sped over, knocking Arrow over and catching the emblem in mid-air. “Thank you.” It said mockingly, fixing the lightning symbol that represented The Flash back on its chest.<br>“You’re WELCOME!” Oliver shouted the signal to his partner.<br>“And that’s my cue to join in the drama.” Barry said as he ran round and round until a wormhole opened up and he ran into it. Appearing outside the trap, he called out to his evil twin. “Hey, don’t tell me you forgot about me.”<br>“H-how did you…”<br>“No time for questions, let’s run.”<br>BOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMM<br>Barry took off, the mannequin hot on his trail. He sped up buildings and down, taking the mannequin on a crazy chase around the entire city. It was a fight for Central City. The mannequin was gaining on him. It was still drawing electricity and charging itself up.<br>“Barry, you’ve got to get it to expend that energy. First, get it to somewhere absent of power.” Cisco’s voice came again.<br>Time to go somewhere ‘un-electrified’. Barry sped across the ocean and started to move in very large circles, in order not to make the mannequin suspicious.<br>“How many percent more, Cisco?” Barry shouted desperately into the earpiece. “I can’t do this forever.”<br>“Keep running, Barry.” Cisco shouted back. “32 percent to go.”<br>Barry headed out into the far, open sea. The mannequin was visibly getting slower. Barry kicked up the water to blind the mannequin’s range of vision and turned back, phasing through the waves of water in the air and saw the mannequin, who was shielding its eyes from the water but still moving.<br>“I owe you a broken nose.” Barry said as he punched the mannequin on the face with enough force to send it flying headfirst across the water like a stone from a slingshot. Barry ran ahead of it to where he had calculated its possible landing. Immediately its head dipped into the water, Barry literally began a super speed punching spree on the mannequin’s body, its head slicing through the water with the force its body was being pummeled with. Barry landed a powerful punch that sent it slicing across the water and moved quickly forward to land another punch right before its entire body fell into the water completely, helping it maintain its momentum. Barry jumped into the water and swum at super speed towards its visible head, hitting it with a punch that sent its entire body up and away over the ocean’s surface. It regained its balance after a few bounces on the water’s surface. Barry headed towards dry land and stopped at the water’s edge. He looked towards the water and saw the mannequin running in unstable bends. Its knees were visibly buckling. As it got near to the beach, its lightning trailed back into its body and disappeared. It moved forward a few feet before falling into the water. Barry raced and brought its body to shore. It had melted back into its former shape and color.<br>STAR LABS<br>“Thank you, Oliver.” Barry said.<br>“No problem, Barry.

A child born of X shall come back to lay claim to his heritage which you have stolen from him, a future you stole from X. He comes with the power of the gods and the wrath of the titans. Your actions now shall determine the future of X and ultimately yourself. Do not take these words lightly for they hold the existence of X. The Seers have spoken! Now go.<br>As the seers turned their backs and faded away from view, the Temple now apparently empty was exited by Uriel who was either in a rush or in a fit of fury and perhaps fear.</p><p>SAME DAY ON X<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;“(Giggling) Awwww, he’s so beautiful.”<br>&nbsp;“I know honey. Isn’t he? Hey he looks just like me!” Jhon exclaimed as he and splash looked at the computer imaging of their unborn child. Splash evidently heavy with child was beaming smiles as the computer had announced the sex of the child to them.<br>“I told you he’d be a boy” Jhon said triumphantly to splash.<br>“No, I told you he was a boy” splash countered ‘And now we can finally start talking about the house.’ ‘I want everything to be perfect for our child.’ ”<br>“We’re gonna need help, diapers, a lot of diapers, and a whole lot of food!” Splash giggled.<br>“Ah I bet he’s gonna wanna exercise too. He’ll be athletic just like his big ol dad’ ‘ha-ha, awww too bad he doesn’t have any siblings. He’s sure gonna have quite a childhood’ ”</p><p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa… who said he won’t have any siblings?’ there’ll be lots of time for us to make more company for him’ ” Jhon said laughing as he playfully tickled splash’s stomach.</p><p>Crack, crack (some sparking sounds could be heard as a hologram popped into life out of nowhere bearing the ever bleak face of cosmos)</p><p>“Uh-oh! That can’t be good” Jhon said the smile immediately vanishing from his face with splash equally bearing a sullen look. They both stood up and went outside to meet an even bigger hologram which was now crowded by a throng of nearby people who had equally come to listen to cosmos’ speech.</p><p>Echoing throughout all of X, a message was being passed by Uriel (The tyrannical ruler of Planet X now known as Cosmos after bonding with the delta force) who instantly popped up as holograms all around planet X;</p><p>“Citizens of X, bear this information for all time. No child born on X shall be allowed to live, neither shall anyone be allowed to leave or enter X until this law is lifted. Do not attempt to breach this law as offenders will be deemed traitors to X and eliminated on the spot!”</p><p>Fear and panic gripped everyone as the live message was announced in every location on X. There was instant chaos on X as everyone rushed to get home. Some ran to unknown locations all over X all as part of futile failed attempts to hide from cosmos and his law but were instantly shot down by cosmos’s army. All over X, screams were heard from people’s houses as soldiers broke down doors and ransacked homes without waiting for permission dragging children away from screaming parents.</p><p>&nbsp;“What do we do jhon?”<br>“We can’t let them do this. Not to him.”<br>“But what do we do splash? We can’t run away. We can’t hide from cosmos. The minute we step outside that door, we’ll be killed”<br>“I would rather die than see our child killed jhon”.<br>Oh splash… “We’ve got to escape. We have to!”<br>And jhon nodded in agreement.</p><p>Later that night, Splash and Lava (known on X as Jhon) left their house and setting it on fire, they moved in the darkness as Lava creating an underground tunnel of lava, carried splash as they glided through the lava-filled tunnel to an unknown military location. “We’re here” Lava announced to Splash as he brought them out of the tunnel and signaled to her to follow him. As soon as they stepped out of the bushes, floodlights were cast on them and shouts of “don’t move!” were heard across the military base.<br>&nbsp;They both froze as the warning went out again. “Don’t move or we will be forced to fire” “Jhon? We can’t let them do this”<br>“Everything will be alright. Just run when I give the signal.”<br>Lava looked back at her and turning into a red-hot rock with lava flowing down all of him and with glowing red eyes, he looked at the direction the light was coming from and yelled “Our son will LIVE!!!”<br>“TAKE HIM OUT!!!!” A soldier yelled. Splash ran and Lava let out a volcanic blast that destroyed the towers on which most of the soldiers were and took out all of the floodlights. He then punched the ground with his lava covered fist and everything around him burst into flames and there was a light earth tremor as ground glowed red and became a lava pool. Gun rays whizzed past him as he threw lava all around the camp with some movements of his hands. “Ugh” he groaned as some gun rays hit his strong rocky back.<br>AAAARGH!!!! He yelled as he sent the lava flying now at twice the speed in every direction and then raised both hands up and slammed his two clenched fists into the earth. The wave alone from the impact knocked the soldiers away before the lava engulfed them.<br>Slowly, he raised his head up and looked around. The military base had been leveled to the point where it could not be recognized as nothing other than a previously active volcano site. Everywhere was red, hot and smoking. He immediately seeing that no one was around, left to find Splash.<br>He finally found her standing in front of a space jump. “This is it. You ready?”<br>To our son! Lava said as he held splash close to himself ready to jump into the space jump when they heard a crackling warbling noise from the space jump and they watched in horror as the space jump closed up before their eyes.<br>“You cannot escape this!”<br>“For treason against the empire, you shall pay with your lives”<br>They both turned back slowly to find themselves surrounded by cosmos’s army with an enraged cosmos sitting on a floating chair behind the armies.</p><p>&nbsp;“Cosmos, we are leaving” Lava said.<br>&nbsp;“No you’re not! Take them out”<br>Lava transforming into his rocky lava self again punched the ground once more and all the soldiers encircling them were immediately flung away. Lava had made the wave from his earth tremor to spread out in all directions when he punched the ground with his fist but allowed it to pass splash without hurting her.<br>The soldiers fired but he created a wall of earth around him and splash and used that to shield them from the rays while occasionally tossing lava at the soldiers. He created a pool of lava which surrounded the wall preventing the soldiers from advancing any further but they still fired rays.<br>“I’m going to get the link hole open” splash said as she changed into a living water sculpture and began moving her arms around in a sporadic gyral manner and bright bluish energy began to flow from her body and a buzzing warbling noise started emanating from the previously closed link as cracks appeared out of nowhere from the air.</p><p>&nbsp;The soldiers finally managed to destroy Lava’s wall of earth and cosmos looking, saw the portal being reopened and with an echoing “NO”, he ripped his robes apart and released a wave of delta beams from his chest at the same moment splash shouted to Lava “It’s open”.<br>Lava had heard splash and turned around to look at splash not seeing the delta beams approaching. Splash saw the impending danger and immediately created a wall of water which exploded as cosmos’s delta beams hit it. The explosion from the beams flung them along with nearby soldiers with a great force. Wasting absolutely no time, she created an even greater wall of water and secured them further by turning the wall into a ball of water which surrounded the both of them. This way, even rays fired from above would not be able to touch them. She sustained the ball of water and amidst the shots being fired by the soldiers at the wall, she still managed to sweep most of them away drowning them in little orb-like water prisons. All the while, cosmos watched waiting for the soldiers to break through the barrier and arrest and eliminate the offending traitors when he saw that splash had left a part of the ball open and un-guarded and was about entering the link hole with Lava. Seized by fear, and an even greater rage, he fired his delta beams at the wall this time greater than the previous wave. Splash had her back turned to cosmos and was facing Lava and as such, did not know the beams were approaching. Lava seeing the beams coming at an alarming velocity reached out to splash in an effort to drag her into the hole before the wave hit but as soon as he touched her, there was a loud explosion and they were both flung into the space jump.</p><p>NO!<br>NO!!<br>NOOOOOO!!!!!! Cosmos yelled after the smoke from the explosion cleared.</p><p>“Should we go after them sir?” a soldier asked.<br>No.<br>“Now, we prepare for war!” Cosmos said smiling evilly to himself and so they marched out of the base while cosmos flew directly to his palace on his chair.</p><p>MINNESOTA, U.S.A. 10:00pm</p><p>Crack, crack, buzz…<br>“Hmm?” a passer-by said to himself.<br>A warbling, buzzing noise was echoing throughout the plains coming from nowhere in particular when all of a sudden, there was a bluish bright light just visible as it appeared from thin air.<br>“Ah show people! They never relent.” The man said to himself and continued walking with his back turned when he had a whoosh sound a very bright flash of light.<br>(Thud)</p><p>“Aaaarrrrgh”<br>“Oof!”<br>Lava and splash both said at once as they fell unto the ground from the portal which had promptly closed up as soon as they landed.<br>The passer-by looked back and saw where the light appeared before; two objects obviously way taller than him. He almost mistook them for objects when Lava stirred and the man obviously scared for life ran off immediately.</p><p>“Raaaah” he yelled muttering under his breath “Stupid kids! Bloody government, well I’ll be pissed!”<br>They both opened their eyes to find they were no longer on X but on earth. They had landed on Minnesota at exactly 10:00pm to be precise. Lava quickly looked around surveying the landscape and checking for any signs of danger. The environment looked strange. Instead of the usual green soil on X, he saw rich, brown earth and the surrounding vegetation which was brown in colour and had dried up after harvest. He looked around some more trying to make anything out which was similar to what they had on X but he found nothing. Sighing with an ignorant satisfaction, he laughed and turned to look at splash who had fallen quite a few feet from him. “Ha-ha-ha. We did it” jhon beamed with a smile only to find splash with a sullen look in her eyes.<br>“Splash?”<br>“SPLAAAAASH!!!” He yelled as he ran to her just in time to catch a falling splash. “No” he said as he saw the big hole just inches from her waist which had gone clean through her. Being the closest to the explosion, the delta beams had ripped right through her before Lava could have a chance to drag her into the portal. Her wall of water albeit uncontrolled, had reduced the velocity and strength of the delta beam making it to only kill her without reaching Lava.<br>“We made it.”<br>“We did it.”<br>“Our son can live away from the tyranny of cosmos and the harshness of X” Lava said trying to be hopeful and force the tears that had welled up in his eyes to go back in but he could not.</p><p>“I’m sorry” splash said. Perhaps we should have stayed back on X. At least our son would have lived.<br>“Don’t speak like this splash. You’re going to be alright okay?”<br>“You’re gonna live and see our boy grow up and become a man. Just hang in there.” Lava said trying to convince her he held her in his hands and cried.</p><p>He was still crying when splash’s hand went limp.<br>“Splash?”<br>&nbsp;“SPLASH!” He yelled but was futile as splash had already died. No splash. You can’t die he said burying his face in her neck and sobbing.<br>Splash suddenly began to glow a bright blue colour which made him raise his head up from her body and as Lava watched, she transformed into a water sculpture and slipped from his fingers and landed on the earth where she was quickly absorbed by the rich loamy soil.</p><p>“No, No, No…”<br>“NOOOO!!!!!!” Lava screamed as he began to glow a bright red colour while his body became completely covered with lava. At the time, he was a dark brown rock but unnerved by splash’s death at the hand of cosmos, he changed to a red-glowing hot volcanic rock. He covered his face with his hands as lava began to stream from all of his body.</p><p>His eyes were becoming increasingly red with hotness and intensity, he gazed up at the sky. “AAAARRRRGHHHHH!!!!!!” he yelled as he erupted with such a force that as the eruption moved away from the point of origin, it changed into a fiery explosion that moved with a wave so great that it destroyed everything in its path for at least 5 miles in every direction. The resulting crater which formed after the blast was 10 miles wide and 200 feet deep.</p><p>Lava in a great anger, thinking and believing all to be lost with nothing to lose, said “I will avenge you!” and with a face full of rage, he jumped back into the space jump to planet X but not before swearing that cosmos would pay for his sins. Lava went back to X and faced cosmos in his fit of rage ultimately beating him but for the use of cosmos’ delta beams which Lava easily lost to and so cosmos beating him almost to the point of death, banished him to the depths of the world. The battle was fierce and the results catastrophic. Nearly more than half of cosmos’ palace was destroyed which promoted cosmos to banish Lava immediately to prevent any further destruction to come to the palace.<br>As soon as the battle was over, cosmos summoned his armies and commanded them.</p><p>“Sweep the planet!”<br>“No one leaves X. Not today, not ever” cosmos yelled to the soldiers as they immediately scattered in all directions. Some minutes later, soldiers were seen arriving at bases and immediately leaving in a great haste as if preparing for all-out war. And they did have an all-out war as they marched all around X, they were greeted with great hostility as everyone, apparently thrown into a state of anguish coupled with anger did not care if their lives were lost in the process. A great riot broke out on Moltin which was the region where Lava and splash had left from. The place was instantly thrown into a state of great chaos as the denizens of the state saw the soldiers approaching. At first, they were hiding behind curtains booing loudly when one of them in anger threw a rock at one of the soldiers which prompted instant retaliation from the soldiers as large numbers of them immediately rushed at the person who had thrown the rock to arrest him but other bystanders began their own assaults and the soldiers, in efforts to defend themselves, fired rays from their guns and killed many bystanders but the bystanders killed by the soldiers was nothing compared to what the denizens did to them. The soldiers were killed in their numbers and were almost completely eliminated save for some few who escaped with injuries but the rest were killed as the denizens used their powers to attack the soldiers. They hurled rocks, created windstorms, electrocuted some and even made some turn against each other; killing others and themselves too.</p><p>In the chase by the denizens against the soldiers, they entered different towns and states and killed any soldier in sight. Other groups also joined them and their numbers despite haven fallen before, increased incredulously and soon they waged an all-out war ultimately arriving at cosmos’ palace. The entire planet which was normally green was now red, Smokey and glowing with fires.</p><p>&nbsp;Cosmos wiped everyone in the palace out with pure strength battling with them in hand combat and when he finally came out of the palace which was now almost complete rubble and cluttered with debris, they would all almost jump on him and subdue him when he released a massive wave of delta beams which instantly threw everything and everyone surrounding him a distance of at least 5 feet into the air in all directions. When they landed, he summoned them to him proclaiming himself undefeatable and told them not to challenge his power.<br>“Go home. Rest, this is not your fight and should there be any rebellion, I will make sure that it will be your last”<br>“Now go!” Cosmos said as he dismissed them with a wave of his hand and that settled everything as the citizens went back home convinced there was no hope of things becoming better.</p><p>&nbsp;Lava roamed the underworld looking for a place to say and fighting everything that dared challenge him. He ultimately had to live in the underworld at the depth of the world in agony and shame but he built himself a temple which is known there as the lava temple where he lives to this day as Lava the lava king.</p><p>PRESENT DAY, MINNESOTA</p><p>&nbsp;“Welcome to Planetary Vision” a young ebullient woman chimed out to a group of people who had walked past the door and into the building as she handed them some leaflets. They were obviously here for a tour and as soon as they collected the leaflets, another attendant met them and took them away showing them about the building. Everything was going smoothly. Tours were being conducted, leaflets were being handed out, in the manager’s office, an interview was being conducted, crates and boxes were being arranged, it seemed everywhere one looked, there was activity. Somewhere in the background, a young man was arranging some radio equipment in boxes and carrying the boxes to a table at planetary vision. He had blue eyes and white hair and was working quickly. Planetary Vision was a Non-Governmental Organization which dealt mainly with galactic stuff and things relating to the universe, solar systems, ancient civilizations, aliens, etc. they were basically the one place to find information about any planetary or galactic enquiry you wished to make. He moved quickly and worked hard totally unaware that he was being watched by a young woman. He was at his last box when he heard a voice behind him say amidst laughter “You work too hard”<br>He turned around to see the young woman staring at him and grinning mischievously.<br>“Excuse me?” he asked.<br>“Sorry. I’ve kind of been stalking you for some time now” she said.<br>“Stalking?” he laughed. “Why would anyone want to stalk me? I’m not exactly some top secret government project” and they both laughed.<br>“I just do that sometimes when I’m bored. Hey you wanna grab a coffee or something sometime later?”<br>“Yeah, sure”<br>“Aight” “So… I’ll see you later” she said licking her lips as she turned her back to leave.<br>“I didn’t catch your name.” he said.<br>“I’m Ginny” she said with a beaming smile<br>“Max”</p>', 'SAME DAY ON X\r\n \r\n “(Giggling) Awwww, he’s so beautiful.”\r\n “I know honey.

Smiling, she went to their bedroom to put on the sexy lining she had ordered earlier that week. She had been planning this for a week now; she finally found the right time to show him what she was made of; how could he ignore her for almost a month? She just couldn\'t take it anymore and was going all out to get him.<br>Mr. Jin was her husband, and they had been married for 2 years now, and though their sex life has always been good but for almost a month now, she noticed that he had been withdrawing and rarely touched her. Some nights, she would ware something very revealing to awaken his desire, but he would just kiss her and cuddle her to bed. Of course she thought he was cheating at some point, and after she did her findings, she found out she was wrong. Her husband loves her and has always shown it; he gets her gift and surprises her with roses and little love notes. What then could be the problem? She thought, Or was he impotent? NO!!! She screamed in her head and scolded herself for thinking about something like that. Well, &nbsp;today she will find out the problem.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Jin had just returned to his office after a series of meetings; this has been going on now for almost a month; he hadn\'t had a spare time except when he slept. Oh! He hurriedly put his hand in his pocket to collect his phone. His lovely wife had sent him something, but he had been too busy to check. Now he had time for her. It was a picture and a write-up which read, “Come home, babyboy, mama is waiting.” He was speechless; he couldn\'t wait to finish the last paperwork on his desk so he could go home to his wife, that woman, she sure knows how to provoke him; he missed her already. As he signed the last paper, the picture his wife sent to him earlier flashed through his mind. He put his phone in his pocket, but not before taking a peek at the picture one more time. He took his bag and car keys and left for home.<br>……………….</p><p><br>&nbsp; She was dressed; she lit the candlestick in the room and sprayed some fragrance over the petals on the bed. The petals reminded her of their 2-year marriage anniversary. Her husband had prepared a surprise for her using similar red petals on the white bedsheets. With a smile on her face, she took the rose on the table and let it sit perfectly on her hair. She smiled, and with the smile on her face, she took the rose on the table and let it sit perfectly on her hair. She smiled with satisfaction. her alarm went off. It was time, just as she reached the sitting room, she heard her husband\'s car honk. She then sat on the table in the center of the living room with her legs parted in a way that her thigh and part of her p***y was revealed, the door opened.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing could have prepared Mr Jin for what he was about to see; he always knew his wife was crazy but he hadn\'t imagined her like this.<br>She was wearing a black see-through net gown that did nothing at covering her; he could clearly see her nipples, he swallowed hard, he was still in shock when her sweet voice brought him back to reality. “You are home honey, come and eat.” Eat? Of course mama I want to eat you up right… He was still mid sentence when she stood up, leaning in on him, she took his bag and press a kiss on his lips, then led him to the dining room. Oh this is the food, the aroma reminded him that he was hungry, he looked at his wife and said, “Babe.” She smiled and led him to sit, she had made rice and beef stew with fried plantain and a glass of orange juice, they sat down to eat,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; His wife is fair skin and had a perfect body shape. While they were eating, he could feel her legs on his thighs. she was fueling his desire; he could no longer focus on the food, he stood up to devour her, but she said in a sluppy tone, “No baby mama put in a lot of effort to make dinner, and she won\'t be happy if you don\'t eat, so be a good boy and eat up.\" Hearing, that he wondered what game she was playing. He decided to play along, smiled, and continue eating.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; They were done with dinner, and she was clearing up the table, she let a spoon drop, and she bent over to pick it, revealing her p***y again. Jin, who had his eyes glued to her the whole time, saw that, and he could feel his other member grow, before he could move, she had gone to the kitchen, so he decided to wait patiently for her to come back.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;************<br>Five minutes passed and no sign of her. He couldn\'t wait anymore and decided to go check her up in the kitchen, but she wasn\'t there. As he turned to go back, he saw a note on the door, “Meet me in the bedroom.” He quickly went to the bedroom and opened the door. The <span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(33,37,41);\">room was dimly lit with red lights</span>. A sweet fragrance covered him. Adjusting his eyes to the light, he saw his wife sitting on the bed in the exact same posture he met her when he came back from work. But this time she parted her legs wider; the rose which she had on her hair earlier was now between her lips, and she tilted her head backwards, revealing her neck and part of her breast, F**K, he muttered. He took long strides towards her, then slowed down a bit when he got close to her. He could clearly see her face now, he smiled, bent over, and kissed her, she put her hands around his neck and deepened the kiss, he tore off his shirt, revealing his abs and packs; she could not help but touch and feel his muscles with her plam, she was jolted back to reality when she felt him pinch her nipples; it was her night, not his; with that, she flipped him over; he was surprised and asked, \"Really mama.\" They both laughed, and she sucking on his nipples he groaned “This woman.” She took her lips off his nipples, kissed him lightly on the lips, and traced kisses down his body as she unbuckled his belt, he was in heaven, his senses returned when he felt her warm, sluppy lips on his dick. But it wasn\'t for long, her lips worked well; he could feel himself building up, she could feel it too. She stopped and hovered over him, while he looked at her with pleading gaza, she smiled, bent and wispiered in his ear “not now baby boy” she sat up and took off her gown revealing all her curves, his hand ran over her body, she was perfect. She took him in her hands and slid him into her “mmmm” she moaned, she slowly started bouncing on him he could feel her wetness, he watched her ride him, “God my wife is beautiful” he thought, now she was bouncing faster on him, he groaned, he was close. He drew her close to himself, lifted her ass and began thrusting faster, she became a moaning mess, “ba……by” she screamed, say my name he whispered in her ear, “Jinnnn” she moaned am coming she moaned breathlessly, “don\'t” he ordered, flipping her over with him on top, lifting her legs to his shoulder revealing her plump pussy that has now turned pink, he slid in her again and “Hmmmm” he groaned “Jinnnn” she moaned, he could feel her building up, “Ba…..by” he was close too he increased his speed, the sight of his wife grasping the sheet was priceless, he had missed this, “I\'m coming” she cried, he left her, thrusting faster and harder, he released himself in her filling her up, he smiled as he bent and kissed her lovingly, laid down beside her, cuddling her in his arms, why have you been avoiding me she asked, he smiled turning her to face him he answered we won the contract babe, frown confused and asked what contract, the one with the Foreign company, her eyes widened, baaabe you didn\'t tell you were going to pursue it she smiled joyously, he draw her back into his arm and replied I know how much you want you to relocate to the states and this company gives us the opportunity, I didn\'t tell you because I didn\'t want to raise your hope and then dash it if the contract didn\'t work, thank you babe for being the best husband, and thank you too for being the best wife, she smiled leaned into him and slept off.</p>', '', NULL, 'draft', 1, 0, NULL, '2024-12-12 07:29:38.510117', '2024-12-12 08:16:44.354975', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, NULL),

My legs felt heavy as I approached the body, but I kept going. Just as I reached out, I felt someone grab my shoulder. Startled, I turned, ready to shove the hand away—</p><p>—and I woke up.</p><p>Ray was leaning over me, fear in his eyes. “Babe, are you okay? Was it a nightmare? I’ve been trying to wake you for ten minutes. I was—”</p><p>I didn’t let him finish. I threw my arms around him, holding him tightly. “It was all a dream,” I whispered. “I love you, Ray. Please, don’t ever leave me.”</p><p>He hugged me back, his voice steady and reassuring. “I’m not going anywhere, babe. I love you too.”</p><p>It took what felt like an eternity for me to calm down. Eventually, I fell asleep again, still holding him tightly. His warmth, his presence—it felt like a second chance. I made a silent promise: I’ll cherish him. I’ll be better for him. I’m never sleeping without my arms around him again.</p>', 'Everything around me turned silent as I grappled with the devastating thought of losing him forever, and despair threatened to consume me.', 'latest', 'published', 1, 7, NULL, '2024-12-14 10:02:48.576912', '2024-12-25 19:17:45.883120', 'A Second Chance in His Arms - Emotional Short Story of Love and Loss', 'A short story about love, loss, and the haunting fear of losing someone you hold dear.

(14, 'Cyber Wolf', 'cyber-wolf', 'post_images/Cyber_Wolf.webp', '<p>The forest was alive with secrets, its vastness cloaked in the muted glow of a moon that hung low and heavy, like a guardian that refused to turn its gaze. Shadows danced and flickered among the ancient trees, their gnarled forms twisted by time and the whispers of countless nights. The air, laden with the scent of damp earth and pine, held an unnatural stillness—a silence that pricked at the edge of instinct. It was as though the forest itself held its breath, waiting for something inevitable.</p><p>Kael moved through the undergrowth with a predator’s grace, his powerful form a seamless part of the nocturnal world. The hair along his arms and back bristled as he paused, his amber eyes scanning the darkness with practiced vigilance. Every step he took was careful, deliberate, each sound muffled by the soft carpet of fallen leaves. Yet, tonight felt different. The usual chorus of insects and rustling leaves had fallen silent, replaced by a tension that seemed to coil around him like a living thing.</p><p>A faint breeze stirred the branches above, carrying with it a scent that made Kael’s stomach churn—a sharp, acrid tang that was foreign and unsettling. He stiffened, the muscles in his legs tightening as his claws sank into the soft soil. The scent was not of prey or rival predators. It was something worse. His nostrils flared as he sniffed again, trying to place it, but the answer eluded him, leaving only a gnawing unease.</p><p>From behind the dense screen of trees, a sound shattered the stillness—a rustling, deliberate and purposeful. Kael turned toward it, his ears twitching as they caught the faint rhythm of padded footsteps. They were too synchronized to belong to prey, too controlled to belong to the aimless wanderings of the forest’s usual denizens. These were the steps of hunters, their intent sharp and unmistakable.</p><p>“Kael,” a deep voice called, smooth yet laced with menace. It was a voice he knew all too well, one that had commanded respect and fear in equal measure.</p><p>From the shadows emerged a towering frame bathed in the moonlight. His silver-flecked fur seemed to shimmer, a cruel contrast to the cold dominance that radiated from him. The Alpha’s golden eyes locked onto Kael, and the faintest smirk curled his lips, a predator savoring the moment before the kill.</p><p>Behind him, more figures stepped into view—wolves Kael recognized, wolves he had trusted. Their gazes were hard, unyielding, their loyalty no longer his to rely on, he could simply smell it. Kael’s heart sank, but he kept his stance firm, even as realization dawned like a blade carving through his resolve. Each face was a story he knew, now twisted by betrayal.</p><p>“Darius,” Kael said, his voice low but steady. “What is this?”</p><p>The Alpha chuckled, a sound devoid of humor. “Justice,” he said, spreading his arms as though presenting a gift. “Your defiance has gone unchecked for too long, Kael. It’s time the pack sees what happens to those who think they can challenge the order.”</p><p>Kael’s lips curled back, revealing sharp fangs that brilliantly glistened in the moonlight. “Challenge? I have done nothing but serve the pack.”</p><p>“Your very existence is a challenge,” Darius snarled, his voice dropping its mockery to reveal the anger beneath. “Your strength, your honor—it’s a threat to my rule. And threats must be eliminated.”</p><p>There simply was no other motive. Darius sought to root out all that threated his rule as the Alpha even before they sprout, and in his eyes, the werewolf before him fit that category all too well.</p><p>Before Kael could respond, Darius lunged. The attack was sudden, a blur of motion that left no time for words. Kael met him head-on, their bodies colliding with a force that reverberated through the forest. Claws slashed and teeth snapped, the air filled with the guttural growls of battle, a cacophony of raw fury and desperation.</p><p>But it wasn’t just Darius. The others joined in, their collective weight overwhelming Kael. He fought with everything he had, his movements fueled by desperation and fury. For a moment, it seemed as though his defiance might hold. He clawed, bit, and twisted, each motion carrying the weight of survival. Then, Darius struck with a precision born of something sinister. His claws raked across Kael’s arms, and the pain was blinding, a white-hot fire that tore through him.</p><p>Kael roared, a sound of both agony and fury, as he felt the sickening tear of muscle and sinew. Blood slicked the ground beneath him as Darius delivered the final blow, his claws driving into Kael’s face. The world went dark, the moon’s light swallowed by an endless void. The last thing Kael heard was Darius’s voice, cold and triumphant. “You’re nothing now. Less than nothing.”</p><p>When Kael awoke, the cold earth was beneath him, and the scent of blood hung heavy in the air. He was alone. The pain was unbearable, searing through his body like molten fire. He tried to move, but his limbs refused to obey. A wave of despair crashed over him, threatening to drown him in its depths. Somewhere in the distance, a howl echoed—long, mournful, and filled with a sorrow that mirrored his own. It was a sound that spoke of loss, of exile, of a life shattered beyond repair. And yet, beneath it all, there was a whisper of something else: a spark of defiance, a promise of vengeance that refused to be extinguished.</p><p>Kael’s world was now one of endless darkness. “My eyes, they should be healed by now.” He staggered through the forest, his movements slow and labored, each inch gained a battle against the cold weight of his own body, making his way beneath the forest canopy in a daze that kept him barely conscious. Time became meaningless, the days and nights blending into a monotonous rhythm of pain and survival. Hunger gnawed at him, its sharp claws an unrelenting torment. He’d lost track of how many days had passed, each one bleeding into the next.</p><p>He’d managed to be aware of his surroundings by sound and smell and mere instinct, the absence of sight forcing his other senses to sharpen far beyond what they usually were. The earthy scent of moss entered his nose, trickles of water from a nearby stream, the distant rustle of leaves in the breeze—his senses were coming back and the pain had finally subsided, enough to let him take account of things. But wait, he tried to feel his face but no sensation followed, His arms—they were gone, the agony he’d been in for days had blinded him to all sensation, but now he was fully conscious and aware of his present state. He was no longer a hunter but prey, vulnerable and exposed, stripped of the power that had once defined him.</p><p>He managed to drag himself up and leaned against the bark of a fallen tree, his breath coming in ragged gasps, “Looks like neither of us is standing tall like we used to, huh? But at least you still have your limbs… even if they’re scattered all over the forest floor.”</p><p>The forest, once his domain, now felt like a labyrinth designed to break him. Each step was a reminder of his weakness, each sound a reminder of the betrayal that had brought him here. The pain in his stumps was constant, a cruel companion that refused to be ignored.</p><p>In the midst of his struggle, a new sound reached his ears—a low, mechanical hum, almost imperceptible against the natural symphony of the wild. Kael froze, his ears straining. It was unlike anything he’d encountered before, a sound that didn’t belong in the forest. It was sterile, precise, and alien.</p><p>“You’re a stubborn one,” a voice said, smooth and calm, cutting through the silence like a knife. It came from everywhere, its tone analytical yet tinged with curiosity. “Most would have succumbed by now.”</p><p>Kael’s head snapped toward the voice, his body tensing. “Who’s there?” he growled, his voice raw from disuse. His throat felt like sandpaper, every word an effort.</p><p>The hum grew louder, and with it came the faint sound of footsteps—measured, deliberate. Kael’s senses flared as he tried to pinpoint the source, but his exhaustion betrayed him. He struggled to lift himself off the ground as he prepared for a fight he knew he couldn’t win.</p><p>“Easy,” the voice said, closer now. “I’m not here to harm you.”</p><p>A faint warmth enveloped him, and Kael felt his body being lifted, though no hands touched him. The sensation was both disorienting and oddly comforting. As consciousness slipped away, the last thing he heard was the voice’s soft murmur: “Let’s see what can be salvaged.”</p><p>Kael woke to an unfamiliar sensation. Warmth. It spread through his battered body like a balm, dulling the relentless ache that had become his constant companion. The air around him smelled sterile, devoid of the forest’s wild, earthy tones. There was no wind, no rustle of leaves—only a steady hum, rhythmic and soothing, like the heartbeat of something vast and unseen, it had to be a creature he didn’t know. Was there even any he didn’t know?</p><p>He tried to move, but his body resisted, heavy and unresponsive. Panic surged briefly before he heard the voice again, calm and analytical, as it had been before.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’re awake,” it said, more a statement than a question. The voice carried an air of detached curiosity, its owner seemingly uninterested in Kael’s growing apprehension.&nbsp;</p><p>“Where am I?” Kael rasped, his throat raw and dry. He tried to lift his head, but the effort sent a jolt of pain through his body, forcing him to collapse back onto the soft surface beneath him.</p><p>“A safe place,” the voice replied. There was a faint clinking sound, like glass against metal, followed by the rustle of fabric. “Rest. You’ll need your strength.”</p><p>“I don’t need your help,” Kael growled, though the words rang hollow. He was powerless, a shadow of the predator he once was.&nbsp;</p><p>A low chuckle echoed in response. “Ah, but you do. And whether you like it or not, I’m the only one willing to give it.”</p><p>The hum shifted, growing louder for a moment before settling into a softer cadence. Kael strained his ears, trying to piece together the sounds and movements around him. The faint beeping of monitors, the hiss of pressurized air, the metallic clatter of instruments—it was unlike anything he’d known.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’re not… one of us,” Kael muttered. It wasn’t a question but a realization. The scents, the sounds—nothing about this place or its owner aligned with the world he knew.</p><p>“No,” the voice admitted without hesitation. “I’m not.” There was a pause, heavy with unspoken meaning. “But I know your kind well enough. And you, Kael, are unlike any of them I’ve ever encountered.”</p><p>“How do you know my name?” Kael demanded, his tone sharp despite his condition.</p><p>“I make it my business to know,” the voice said, cool and unbothered. Footsteps approached, measured and deliberate, until Kael felt the presence of someone standing nearby. “You’re a fascinating specimen. Stubborn. Resilient. Even after all you’ve endured, you refused to die. That is no small feat.”</p><p>Kael turned his head toward the sound, his blind eyes narrowing. “What do you want from me?”</p><p>“Want?” The voice seemed amused. “I want nothing. What I offer, Kael, is a choice. One that most in your position never have the luxury to make.”</p><p>A faint whirring sound followed, and Kael felt something cool press against his arm—what remained of it. The sensation was both alien and oddly familiar, like the ghost of a touch or a phantom itch, an impossible sensation at a location that just isn’t there.&nbsp;</p><p>“You can stay as you are,” the voice continued, its tone softening slightly. “Broken. Lost. A shadow of your former self, crawling through the dirt until the world finally finishes what your pack began.”</p><p>Kael’s jaw tightened, the weight of the words pressing against the raw wound of his pride. “Or?” he asked, though he wasn’t sure he wanted to hear the answer.</p><p>“Or,” the voice said, and for the first time, there was a hint of something more—a spark of intrigue, perhaps even hope. “You can rise. Stronger. Faster. Unbound by the limitations of flesh and blood. You can reclaim what was taken from you… and more.”</p><p>Kael’s heart pounded in his chest, the offer hanging in the air like a predator’s snare. He didn’t trust this stranger, this disembodied voice that spoke in riddles. Yet, the alternative was a slow, pitiful death, alone and forgotten.</p><p>“Who are you?” Kael asked finally, his voice barely above a whisper.<br>There was a pause, as though the speaker was considering the weight of the answer. When the voice returned, it carried an edge of authority.<br>“I am Dr. Elias Voss,” it said. “And I can give you a future.”</p><p>Kael’s breath caught, the name landing with no familiarity but heavy with intrigue. A human, clearly confident and commanding, whose presence alone seemed to demand attention. Kael had never heard of him, yet the tone of the man’s voice and the promise in his words made him seem larger than life.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of you,” Kael said, his tone laced with suspicion. “What is it you do?”<br>“I help those who think they have no path forward,” Voss replied smoothly. “I give them something greater. Something… new.”</p><p>Kael hesitated, the weight of the moment pressing down on him. His instincts screamed at him to refuse, to reject the offer and cling to whatever shred of pride he had left. But pride wouldn’t mend his broken body or quench the fire of vengeance that burned in his chest.</p><p>&nbsp;“What’s the cost?” he asked, his voice hardening.</p><p>Voss chuckled softly. “Everything, Kael. And nothing. What I offer is not mere restoration. It is transformation. You will be more than you were… and less.”</p><p>Kael’s jaw tightened, his thoughts a whirlwind of anger, fear, and desperate hope. He had already lost everything—his pack, his honor, his body. What else was there to lose? And what might he gain?</p><p>“I’ll do it,” he said at last, his voice steady despite the storm raging within him. “But if you betray me…”</p><p>Voss cut him off, his tone sharp but not unkind. “Betrayal is not my way, Kael. I do not take lightly the trust you’ve given me. Now rest. The path ahead will not be easy.”</p><p>Kael exhaled slowly, the tension in his body easing as exhaustion overtook him once more. As the hum of machinery grew louder, he let himself drift into the void, clinging to the faint glimmer of hope that perhaps, just perhaps, this was the beginning of something new.<br><br><i>(Coming Soon...)</i></p>', 'The moon hung low, casting a pale glow over the dense forest.
